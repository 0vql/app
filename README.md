> Welcome to the main README.

**This repo consists of 3 projects.**

## API

- The backend of the website.
- Includes the WebSocket and REST API.

## Utils

- API and Website are both dependent on utils.
- Used for shared files in both websites (i.e. types, utils).
- Reduce need for syncing files between projects.
- Reduces code duplication

## Website

- The UI.
- Cool but useless without the API running in the background.
